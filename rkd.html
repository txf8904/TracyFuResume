        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                RKD Game is a game review app that provides a series of reviews about the classic and 
                newest arcade games and provides the gaming community for gamers. The app is geared toward 
                people who have an interest in arcade games and looking for friends to play together with. 
            </p>

        <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
            <h4>Problem:</h4>
            <p>
                Arcade gamers often can't find people who have similar interests in the real life. 
                Unlike online games, they are able to community with each other through voice chat that 
                builds into the game. The arcade games are more like offline, face-to-face games. 
                Therefore, arcade gamers are looking for a platform that can provide information and news 
                about arcade games and find their own unique gamer community.
            </p>

            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                The application provides people with information about classic and newest arcade games, 
                so no matter whether the user is a new arcade gamer or a fanatic arcade gamer,  
                you can find your game here.
                Moreover, there will never be alone because there is always a community for you to share your fun 
                with each other.
            </p>

            <h4>Persona:</h4>
            <p>Lewis is a 3rd-year college student who needs updated on the newest game every week because 
                he has a heavy schedule for his college.</p>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
            <h4>Wireframes:</h4>
            <p>For the home screen, I realized that quick access to interesting games process helps users save
                time. Meanwhile, the users also need to explore the newest/popular games.</p>
                <img src="assets/RKDImg/Wireframes.png" alt="home page wireframes">
            <p>Moreover,the wireframes include the ranking page, search/menu page, discover page, 
                and game community/group page.</p>

            <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype:</h4>
            <p>
                Based on the digital wireframes, the low-fidelity prototype has a primary user flow that finds a game 
                review from different entry points in a quick and easy way. <br>

        <h2>Refining the design</h2>
            <h4>Usability Study:</h4>
            <p>
                Since we are creating a new app, we need to find out if the main user experience, 
                finding a game review, and connecting to a game community, are easy for users to complete.
                <br><br> 
                The usability study focuses on five questions:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.How long does it take a user to find a game review?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. What can we learn from the user flow to find a game review?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Are there parts of the user flow where users get stuck?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Are there more features that users would like to see included in the app?<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Do users think the app is easy or difficult?<br>
                <br>
                To solve these questions, I conducted an unmoderated usability study that has five participants involved with different gender and age gap.
                After watching and talking with participants, I collected their options and summarized them into three insights.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Insights:</span>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Search: Users need a way to find a game review more quickly without having to go through the Ranking or Discover<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Interface: Users need a more friendly interface to move smoothly in the app<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Game Community: Users need more connections with friends and others to have more fun outside of the game<br>
                <br>
                Based on the insights, I made following changes:
                <br><br>
                First, I added a quick search feature for the search function. It is not only allowed users
                to find the hottest topic but also can help users to limit the result to what they are 
                looking for.
                <img src="assets/RKDImg/change1.png" alt="wireframe update 1"><br><br>
                Also, the early design allowed users to use the search functions in a specific location. 
                I added the search bar at the top of the screen, so the users can access it anytime. 
                Moreover, change the navigation system from a pop-up menu to a fixed position.
                <img src="assets/RKDImg/change2.png" alt="wireframe update 2">
                Last, I refine the game community more clearly and add login/sign-up pages.

                <img src="assets/RKDImg/change4.png" alt="wireframe update 4">

            </p>

            <h4>Mockup:</h4>
            <p>
                After making changes to the wireframes, I updated it into mockups.
            </p>

            <h4>High-fidelity Prototype:</h4>
            <p>
                The final high-fidelity prototype presented a cleaner user flow for finding and leaving a 
                game review process. It also meets user needs for the portfolio page and connects with 
                the game community and other players.

        <h2>Final</h2>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>
                RKD Game App is my first UX design project in my study journey. 
                While designing the RKD Game App, I started to understand the process of a full UX 
                design cycle. Along the way, I learned that the initial ideas for the app are just a start 
                point. The final product is not what I as a designer want, it is about what users want 
                and need.<br>
                <br>
                At the beginning of the design, I assumed that I was a user who doesn't really into arcade 
                games but wants to find some new game. Therefore, as a new gamer, I assumed that users 
                want to the app tell them what to play instead of helping them find what are they 
                looking for.
                Moreover, my initial research was off-topic a little bit, it is more focus on what 
                kind of game reviews users want instead of what kind of features they are looking for 
                in a game review app.<br>
                <br>
                As a result, the first usability study shows that a lot of participants can't 
                find game reviews as they want because I ignored the importance of search.
                In addition, I also learned that usability studies are the key element in the process through the design. 
                <br><br>
                It is an exciting and confusing process, but I eventually get over the difficulty and 
                call it a success.
