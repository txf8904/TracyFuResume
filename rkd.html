        <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
        <p>
            Arcade gamers often can't find people who have similar interests in the real life. 
            Unlike online games, they are able to communicate with each other through voice chat that 
            builds into the game. The arcade games are more like offline, face-to-face games. 
            Therefore, arcade gamers are looking for a platform that can provide information and news 
            about arcade games and find their own unique gamer community.
        </p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Designing a new application based on game reviews that help arcade gamers to 
                find their own community online.
            </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <h5>
            <ul>
                <li>90% of users found it useful</li>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            RKD Game App is my first UX design project in my study journey. 
            While designing the RKD Game App, I started to understand the process of a full UX 
            design cycle. Along the way, I learned that the initial ideas for the app are just a start 
            point. The final product is not what I as a designer want, it is about what users want 
            and need.<br>
            <br>
            At the beginning of the design, I assumed that I was a user who doesn't really into arcade 
            games but wants to find some new game. Therefore, as a new gamer, I assumed that users 
            want to the app tell them what to play instead of helping them find what are they 
            looking for.
            Moreover, my initial research was off-topic a little bit, it is more focus on what 
            kind of game reviews users want instead of what kind of features they are looking for 
            in a game review app.<br>
            <br>
            As a result, the first usability study shows that a lot of participants can't 
            find game reviews as they want because I ignored the importance of search.
            In addition, I also learned that usability studies are the key element in the process through the design. 
            <br><br>
            It is an exciting and confusing process, but I eventually get over the difficulty and 
            call it a success.
