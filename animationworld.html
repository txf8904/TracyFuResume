        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                YHZ 3D Animator is a showcase website to help a 3D animation student build a 
                portfolio website for a potential job opportunity. 
                
                The client is a new graduate student who does not have a lot of design projects and job 
                experience. 
                <br><br>
                Therefore, the client is looking for a showcase portfolio website that can best 
                show the potential employer who she is and what she does.

                Also, the client wants the portfolio website to be user-friendly 
                by providing clear navigation and a simple showcase for 3D animation works.

        <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
            <h4>Problem:</h4>
            <p>
                I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better 
                understand the user and needs. I discovered that many new-grad students faced the problem 
                that limits of work can show to their potential employers. However, most good portfolio 
                examples are people who have worked in the industry for many years with a lot of work. 
                This caused a lack of confidence for new-grad students to have their own visual showcase. 
            </p>

            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                To solve the main problem, most of the works are based on college projects which did not 
                have a big title/brand, I think it is important to have a focus point on the website. 
                Most portfolio websites is showing all the work on the website without a unique point 
                that grabs attention immediately. Also, most 3D animation portfolio websites show their 
                works without a lot of information about the works which creates a simple feeling that meets the client's requirements.
            </p>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
            <h4>Sitemaps:</h4>
            <p>
                My primary goal here is to create a simple and clear website. Also, fewer pages will show 
                the focus points more easily and hide the disadvantage, lack of work, away. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/3DAnimation/sitemap.png" alt="sitemap">

            <h4>Wireframes:</h4>
            <p>
                Next, I sketched out paper wireframes for the home screen on my website. 
                I keep thinking about how to have a focus point when the visitors first view the websites. 
                Meanwhile, show enough information that can show who the owner of the website is.
            </p>

            <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype:</h4>
            <p>
                Next, I connected all the screens and added quick access components for the main user flow.
            </p>

        <h2>Refining the design</h2>
            <h4>Usability Study:</h4>
            <p>
                To better solve the client the problem, a face-to-face meeting was conducted.
                <br><br>
                After reviewing the basic feature and design for the website, the client brings up three 
                considerations about the website.
                <br><br> 
                First, the homepage focus point is not obvious. 
                The work screenshot on the right and the introduction word and self avatar on the left have 
                equal weight on the page. 
                <br><br>
                Second, the work page does not have a focus point. Also, if the website owner has a small number of works, 
                tiled the page with animation work is not a good way to show it.
                <br><br>
                Last, the client does not think that contact information needs a whole webpage to show.
            </p>

            <h4>Mockup:</h4>
            <p>
                Based on the feedback from the usability study, I made changes to improve the how mage. 
                One of the changes I made was changing the size of the picture and font. By decreasing 
                the size of the person's picture and the word “Hello”, the focus can move to the name and 
                title.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/3DAnimation/change1.png" alt="change #1">
                <br>
                To make the work page has a focus point, I changed a showcase into a slideshow on top 
                which can highlight the work the owner wants the visitors to focus on. Also, this way 
                will show fewer artworks.<br><br>
                <img src="assets/3DAnimation/chang2.png" alt="change #2">
                <br>
                Last, deleting the contact page and moving the contact information to the footer and about page.
            </p>

            <h4>High-fidelity Prototype:</h4>
            <p>
                My hi-fi prototype followed the same user flow as the lo-fi prototype with the design changes made after the usability study.
            </p>

        <h2>Final</h2>
            <h4>Accessibility considerations:</h4>
            <p>
                There are two accessibilitiy considerations in the website. 
                First, I avoid rich color theme, keep the website in a color blind friendly. 
                Second, I used word as navigation instead of icons to help user easier to understand the website.
            </p>

            <h4>Takeaways:</h4>
            <p>
                <span>Impact:</span><br>
                My clients shared that the design was clear and simple as she needs. A good design and focus point solve the problem of lack of work.
                <br><br>
                <span>What I learned:</span><br>
                During the process, I found out that a small change in the component will have an impact on 
                the overall design. Also, it is important to keep listening to your client’s needs and make 
                changes to fit their needs.
            </p>

            <h4>Next Step</h4>
            <p>
                1. Identify any additional fractures that need to add on to maximize the purpose of the website.
                <br>
                2. Create the website by using HTML5, CSS, and JS.
