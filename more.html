        <h1>Beyond UX Design,</h1>
        <h5>I'm also a game designer.</h5>
        <p>
            From my point of view, UX design and game design are very similar, they are like cousins to each other.
            UX design is more about creating a friendly user experience for the users, 
            and game design creates a user experience with the challenge.
            <br><br>
            UX design and game design both belong to human-computer interaction, which focuses on the interaction between the users and computers.
            I have a great passion for this topic and would like to learn more about this topic in the future.
