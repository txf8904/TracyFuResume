                            Pay ‘x’ amount of currency to start a rescue mission in varying regions of 
                            space, unlocking new ones as you progress and reach the animal rescue threshold 
                            of the previous region.
                        </li>
                        <li>A rescue mission consists of an endless runner-like stage(think jetpack joyride) 
                            that progressively gets more difficult. The player must fly around and dodge 
                            incoming meteors, small planets, and rocket missiles, all the while collecting  
                            money and rescuing as many stranded animals as they can. The rescue mission will 
                            go on as long as the player can keep up, but will scale in difficulty with the 
                            player's skill (thus guaranteeing an eventual loss). An alternative would be to set 
                            some type of time limit. Perhaps we will even experiment with fun gravity-shifting mechanics.
