                            but there is no way to escape. The 2nd sense is that when the trauma goes to the 
                            public, most people see it as a story and see the victim like a monkey in the state. 
                            However, in the end, there will be someone who would like to help. 
                            The last sense shows that even everything falls down part, there still is a way out 
                            with love and care.

                            bullying. It is non-stop 24/7 bullying and more horrifying because nobody
