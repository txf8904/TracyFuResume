        <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
        <p>
            The United States has a larger immigrant population, about 14.4% of the United States 
            population are immigrants. Most immigrants came to the U.S. looking for a better life. 
            However, there are many difficulties in their way of finding a job, such as language embarrassment or 
            trade unfairly in the job place.
        </p>
    
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Design a tool that will help first-generation immigrants to find a job and help 
                them to know if they are traded fairly in the workplace. 
            </p>
    
        <h2>Outcome</h2>

            <ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            The participants of the initial user interview are all of the young generations which did 
            not include the older generation. These two age ranges have very different user pain 
            points which cause the first version did not solve the user pain points. This leads me 
            to change a lot of detail in the project. Therefore, I learned that good user research is 
            very important at the beginning.
