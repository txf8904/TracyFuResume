        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                First-gen Job is a job search tool to help first-generation immigrants. 
                First-gen Jobâ€™s primary target users include people who are just come to the U.S. 
                and have language embarrassment and people who came to the U.S. for a little while but 
                still have difficulty assimilating into society.
            </p>

        <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
            <h4>Problem:</h4>
            <p>
                The United States has a larger immigrant population, about 14.4% of the United States 
                population are immigrants. Most immigrants came to the U.S. looking for a better life. 
                However, there are many difficulties in their way of finding a job, such as a language or 
                trade unfairly in the job place.
            </p>

            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                Design an app that will help first-generation immigrants to find a job and help 
                them to know if they are traded fairly in the workplace. 
            </p>

            <h4>Persona:</h4>
            <p>
                Milo is a college student of first-generation immigrants who needs to find a part-time job because she needs money for her college tuition and helps her parents in their store at the same time.            </p>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
            <h4>Wireframes:</h4>
            <p>After brainstorming, I decided that the home page needs to have these elements: 
                the logo, the search bar, navigation, user portfolio, the job recommendation area, 
                the saved job area, the message icon, the notification icon, and the news and tips area.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/Job/paper wireframe.png" alt="paper wireframe">
            <p>
                <br>
                After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I create the initial designs for the 
                First-gen Job app. These designs focus on searching for jobs, getting to know the company, 
                and knowing the salary to help get all the information that need for a job hunt.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                The wireframes also include a home page without logging in or signing up and a process of 
                signing up. In addition, it also has job search results, company pages, salaries page, 
                and company search results.
            </p>

            <h4><br><br>Low-fidelity Prototype:</h4>
            <p>
                 To prepare for usability testing, I create a low-fidelity prototype that connected the 
                 user flow of creating an account, searching for a job, and getting to know the company 
                 and salary.
            </p>

        <h2>Refining the design</h2>
            <h4>Usability Study:</h4>
            <p>
                To better understand if the product meets users' needs, I conduct an usability 
                study that has 6 participants of different gender aged 24 to 48 who are first-generation 
                immigrants. Each section is about 30-50 minutes long. After watching and having a deep 
                conversation with the participants, I realized a major mistake I had made.
                <br><br>
                In the previous research, the focus was on young generation immigrants who had gone to 
                school in the United States, but there is a large percentage of first-generation immigrants 
                who come to the U.S. in their mid-age and have more difficulty than the young generation.
                <br><br>
                After collecting and reviewing the feedback, I realized that a lot of first-generation 
                immigrants have language problems, and they would like to work with people who have the 
                same background as them.  Moreover, a lot of them focus on a job that does not require an 
                educational background.Also, they also worried about if their employer will trade them 
                equally because they do not fully understand the employment law in this new country.
                <br><br>
                Based on the feedback, I create another <span>persona</span> to rich out the user's character.<br>
                Eiji is a new immigrant who needs to find a full-time job as a product manager because he needs to provide a quality lifestyle for his family.
                <br>
            </p>
            <img src="assets/Job/Persona2.png" alt="second persona">
            <p>
                <br>
                Next, I summarized the feedback into three insights.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Insights:</span>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                1. Sign Up Process: The users want an easy sign-up process and add detailed information later on by using a user profile.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                2. Search: The users want to add an advantage search that can limit the results.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                3. Salary and Company information: The users preferred to have more information related to salary and company.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            

            <h4>Mockup:</h4>
            <p>
                Based on the insights from the usability studies, I applied design changes like a short 
                and easy sign-up process and letting users add their detailed information, education, 
                and work experience, to their user profile.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                Additional design changes included adding an advantage search by hovering the mouse to the arrow.
                <br>

                The full mockup is shown below:<br>

        <h2>Final</h2>
            <h4>What I learned:</h4>
            <p>
                The participants of the initial user interview are all of the young generations which did 
                not include the older generation. These two age ranges have very different user pain 
                points which cause the first version did not solve the user pain points. This leads me 
                to change a lot of detail in the project. Therefore, I learned that good user research is 
                very important at the beginning. 
            </p>

            <h4>Next Step:</h4>
            <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                1. Conduct a usability study for a hi-fi prototype.                
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                2. Add more educational resources for users to learn about new skills to get a job.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                3. Add employer site to post the jobs.<br>
