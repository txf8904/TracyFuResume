                <!--
                <p>
                    This application is intended to help keep track of the inventory
                    expenses, slaes, and profit for a coffee shop. The application write
                    in Python language with SQL to connect to database. <br>
                    This project has two phase, first is an indvidual project that build basic application 
                    that does not connect to database, and sencond is a team project that
                    associate with create database and using database to save inventory, sale,
                    and profit data.
                    <br><br>
                    In the first phase, the application has a fully funtion system without previously data saving.
                    The application has a basic interface. There are three main section, inventory, building an order, and placing and cancel an order.
                    Since it does not connect to the database, everytime the application start with zero inventory, zero expenses.
                    <br>
                    In the inventory  section, the shop allowed to purchase coffee grounds, creamer, sugar, and cups. As the user puirchases inventory,
                    the interface will show how much inventory is in stock, hat the total expenses are, and the profit.
                    There no limit to add inventory.
                    <br>
                    In the building an order, the user can specify the quantity and whether or not the coffee has crean and/or sugar. 
                    When they click add to order will add a line item to the output. However, the inventory, sales, and profit values will not change yet  
                    before placing an order. 
                    <br>
                    In the placing/cancel an order, the user can clicked Place Order only when theere is sufficient inventory for the order.
                    If there is, the inventory, total sales, and profit must be updated. If there is not enough inventory, and error message must be 
                    presented to the user and the order cannot go through. When Cancel Order is clicked, the order that is setup within the listbox will be cleared 
                    and no updates to inventory, total sales, or profits should be made. 
                </p>-->
