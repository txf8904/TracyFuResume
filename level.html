                <h2>Music Notes</h2>
                <h4>
                    The Theme is about mental health. The story is about a piano 
                    musician who enjoyed the music at first. Then with all the 
                    pressure put on him, he becomes more and more week and metal 
                    unstable. In the end, he traps himself in his jail, and there 
                    seems a way to get out, but he cannot. 
                    <br><br>
                    The first environment uses an asymmetrical balance. 
                    The music notes on the right side with the extended piano work 
                    path become a balance. The musician works on the sky with his 
                    piano and music. At this moment, he is enjoying his music. 
                    Then, when he blacks out, he weak up in a word that with the 
                    giant piano. This area is the logical area. There only have the 
                    piano and nothing else. At this moment, the musician feels the 
                    pressure from the vast piano. Then, he gets into the world with 
                    unstable mental issues, which is an asymmetrically balanced area. 
                    He walks into the sky and sees a stair. While he walks down the stair, 
                    more and more get broken down. That means his mental stats fall apart. 
                    At the end of the stair, he saw a room with a piano keyboard around. 
                    This is the area with a single repeat shape. The most place he saw is 
                    black, and there is only light in front of him. He walks to the light. 
                    However, there no way for him to get out. The last area is emotional are. 
                    Music notes flow from the sky to the windows, but the musician cannot get 
                    out from it. <br><br>
                    The world is created base on black and white. 
                    The sky means freedom, but he lost that freedom along the way. 
                    He sees hope in the end, but how to get out will be a new challenge.

                <h2>Post Trauma</h2>
                <h4>
                    The central theme of the video is post-trauma. 
                    The 1st sense is proper after the trauma happened, 
                    which the victim tries to escape, but there is no way to escape. 
                    The 2nd sense is that when the trauma goes to the public, 
                    most people see it as a story and see the victim like a monkey 
                    in the state. However, in the end, there will be someone who 
                    would like to help. The last sense shows that even everything 
                    falls down part, there still is a way out with love and care.  
                    <br><br>
                    The idea of this project is from the movie "Room," 
                    a woman has been kept in the basement for years before she 
                    and her son escape. When she gets out, the public is focused 
                    on her story and kept reminding her about her years of being 
                    raped and kidnapped. Also, everything is different than she 
                    remembers. In the end, her son saves her life and makes her move 
                    forward to the future of life. Also, the TV show "Hannibal" is 
                    where I get the idea of using deer as a lead.

                <h2>War</h2>
                <h4>
                    The central theme for this design is antiwar, 
                    and the central concept is the war does not bring anything good, 
                    only pain. <br><br>
                    The story is about a man who used to have a beautiful life, 
                    a wonderful family until the war started. He became a soldier 
                    during the war and protected his country. When he comes back 
                    from the war, everything he used to own is gone.

                    The player wakes up in front of a vast computer, the keyboard 
                    is typing, and later the player walks into the monitor. 
                    The player walks into the internet world, and cyberbullying 
                    words are followed by the player everywhere. <br><br>
                    The maze is trying to tell the player that cyberbullying is 
                    different from bullying, and it is non-stop 24/7 bullying and 
                    more horrifying because nobody knows who starts it or who says it.
